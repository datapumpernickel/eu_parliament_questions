According to recent news reports, Adnan Rasheed, leader of the Pakistani jihadist group TTP, has sent a letter to Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl who was shot several times by a Taliban gunman at the end of last year, but who survived thanks to emergency medical treatment. Sixteen-year-old Malala was targeted by the extremist for describing the suicide attacks that are carried out in the Swat valley and in particular in her hometown of Mingora, destroying a number of schools and other public buildings.
In the letter, Adnan Rasheed justifies the Taliban attacks by claiming that Malala was shot not because of her love of school and studying, but because of the ‘smear campaign’ that she ran against the Taliban.
Moreover, Pakistan ranks only slightly above sub-Saharan Africa with regard to female education, since a Unesco study published last year reveals that around 62% of Pakistani girls have no access to primary education.
Lastly, according to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, ‘The terrorists showed what frightens them most: a girl with a book. […] Nowhere in the world should it be an act of bravery for a young girl to go to school.’

At its November plenary session, the European Parliament adopted the Commission’s proposal for a regulation on short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps (COM(2010) 0482). The outcome of the negotiations involves a ban on trading in naked credit default swaps. Advocates of this ban argue, inter alia, that it has a dampening effect on the number of damaging automated computer transactions.
In its impact assessment for its proposal to introduce a financial transactions tax, the Commission writes that the number of automated computer transactions will fall as a result of this proposal.

How can the leadership of the USA be called to account in future for the pledges made by President Obama at the COP21 conference?,Question for written answer P-001545/2016to the CommissionRule 130Zoltán Balczó (NI),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-8-2016-001545_EN.html,23-02-2016,P-001545/2016,2014-2019,2016,2,hungary,Non-attached Members,2014-2019_2016_hungary_non-attached-members_2.html,17,P-001545_2016,"
The COP21 conference, at which commitments were entered into globally, is described as being of historic importance. One decisive set of elements in these important commitments is the USA, the pledges made by President Obama and their fulfilment. If a new presidential administration takes office, at what level can it be held to these pledges?
The judges performing the role of a constitutional court in the USA have ruled by 5:4 in favour of those preponderantly Republican-governed States and big American businesses which lodged an application against President Obama’s ambitious programme to prevent climate change. Under the Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at creating ‘clean power stations’, America’s power stations would have to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions drastically by 2030 — by 32% in relation to the 2005 level. According to a brief statement by the judges, the implementation of the regulations is to be suspended until the legal proceedings have been completed. In view of this year’s presidential elections and the Republican majority within the court, it is very likely that the proceedings will continue until the very end of January 2017, until the swearing-in of the new President, so it will probably be the new presidential administration that decides on the implementation of President Obama’s programme, too.

Drugs trafficking through the Internet,Question for written answer E-007301/2014to the CommissionRule 130Elissavet Vozemberg (PPE),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2014-007301_EN.html,30-09-2014,E-007301/2014,2014-2019,2014,4,greece,Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats),2014-2019_2014_greece_group-of-the-european-people-s-party--christian-democrats-_4.html,60,E-007301_2014,"
The recently published 2014 EU report on drugs stresses that Europe is an important destination for controlled substances and estimates that 1 in 4 adults in the EU has used an illegal substance at some time in his or her life. Furthermore, according to statistics, every year approximately one million seizures of illegal substances are reported in Europe.
However, the Internet is characterised as a growing market: it plays an increasingly important role as regards the means by which drugs are being trafficked, since it is becoming more and more common for drugs to be sold to traffickers and consumers via the ‘Deep Web’ (websites that maintain the anonymity of the users whose identity is not revealed by search engines). At the same time, it is becoming extremely difficult to control this trafficking, as web hosting providers and payment processing service providers may be located in a different country.
In view of the above, will the Commission state:
—
 Does it have any information showing the extent of trafficking in drugs and other psychotropic substances in the EU via the Internet?
—
 Since, due to austerity or fiscal consolidation programmes, many Member States have made spending cuts in the areas of health, public order and security, does it consider that sufficient funds are available for programmes and services related to drugs in the Member States (prevention, treatment/rehabilitation, social integration)?

VP/HR - UK military exports to Bahrain,"Question for written answer E-003231/12by Pino Arlacchi (S&D), Andrea Cozzolino (S&D), Frieda Brepoels (Verts/ALE), Ivo Vajgl (ALDE), Oreste Rossi (EFD), Sabine Lösing (GUE/NGL), Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE), Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL), Keith Taylor (Verts/ALE), Ana Gomes (S&D), Helmut Scholz (GUE/NGL), Rui Tavares (Verts/ALE), Mariya Nedelcheva (PPE) and Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE)to the Commission",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-7-2012-003231_EN.html,26-03-2012,E-003231/2012,2009-2014,2012,1,belgium,Europe of freedom and democracy Group,2009-2014_2012_belgium_europe-of-freedom-and-democracy-group_1.html,20,E-003231_2012,"
Newly released official figures have disclosed that, despite the recent violent crackdown in Bahrain, the British Government has approved, over the past months, the sale of military equipment to that country.
In February 2011, following the exposure of questionable arms sales to Bahrain, Libya and Egypt, the British Government announced a review of its arms export licensing policy. In March 2011, accordingly, the UK declared that it had revoked 122 licences, including 44 covering military exports to Bahrain.
However, in the case of Bahrain the UK quickly resumed its arms transfers. By June 2011 it was back to business as usual, ignoring the continuing violence against civilians and arrests of activists in the country.
The latest statistics available, covering the third quarter of 2011 and published on the website of the UK’s Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills, show that the UK has licensed military exports to Bahrain — including gun silencers, weapon sights, rifles, naval guns and technology for artillery — to the value of GBP 1.3 million.
The criteria of the EU common position on arms exports require Member States to refuse a licence if there is a ‘clear risk’ that ‘the military technology or equipment to be exported might be used for internal repression’.

In view of the above:
1.
Is the Vice-President/High Representative aware of the UK’s sales of military equipment to Bahrain, which run contrary to the EU common position on arms exports?
2.
What measures will the Vice-President/High Representative take to put an end to this situation and promote stricter implementation by Member States of the criteria of the EU common position?

Unacceptable law on putting down stray dogs in Romania,Question for written answer E-011392/2011to the CommissionRule 117Andrea Zanoni (ALDE),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-7-2011-011392_EN.html,24-11-2011,E-011392/2011,2009-2014,2011,2,italy,Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe,2009-2014_2011_italy_group-of-the-alliance-of-liberals-and-democrats-for-europe_2.html,177,E-011392_2011,"
On 22 November 2011 the Romanian Parliament adopted a new national law giving the country’s mayors greater powers to decide how to deal with stray dogs. To combat the problem of strays, the new law introduces the possibility of sick, aggressive or dangerous dogs being put down within only three days of capture. The procedures for local councils to take this decision are not specified, and the concept of ‘public consultation’ on putting down dogs that are not sick or dangerous after 30 days remains vague. Promulgation of the law by the Romanian President, Traian Băsescu, is now awaited.
International animal charities such as Save the dogs, Four Paws and CAROdog maintain that the Romanian Parliament’s decision is unjustified and is guided only by economic interests. According to the WHO Expert Committee on Rabies, Eighth Report (Geneva 1992, Series No 824, p. 31), ‘There is no evidence that removal of dogs has ever had a significant impact on dog population densities or the spread of rabies.’

—
Does the Commission consider that this law is in conflict with Article 13 of the Lisbon Treaty, which defines animals as ‘sentient beings’?
—
What is the Commission’s opinion of this law in the light of written declaration 26/2011 ‘on dog population management in the European Union’ adopted by the European Parliament on 13 October 2011, which expressly ‘calls on the Member States to adopt comprehensive dog population management strategies which include measures such as dog control and anti-cruelty laws’?
—
What concrete action does the Commission intend to take on the protection of dogs in Romania as part of the 2013-2018 strategy for animal welfare set for the end of the year?

Native to North America, the grey squirrel Scirus carolinensis was introduced into the UK at the beginning of the 20th century.
The grey squirrel, which is not native to European ecosystems, drives out the red squirrel Scirus vulgaris by depriving it of its habitat and introducing the parapoxvirus. The grey squirrel carries this virus, but is itself unaffected by it.
The proliferation of the grey squirrel also has an adverse impact on local ecosystems, in particular by depriving certain bird species of their habitat. Both these phenomena have been observed in the UK, where the red squirrel is facing imminent extinction.
In accordance with Regulation 1143/2014 of 22 October 2014 and its annex, the grey squirrel is recognised as an invasive species. Regulation 2015/736 imposes a ban on introducing it into the EU.
1. Will the Commission encourage measures to control the grey squirrel in territories where it has not yet officially become established?

According to recent figures, the Council Decisions introducing temporary measures for international protection in Italy and Greece are still being poorly implemented(1). The measures include the introduction of a scheme, among others, to relocate refugees from Greece and Italy to other Member States in an effort to share and allocate proportionally the burden of migration flows in Europe(2). It is indicative that to date only about 11% of the agreed relocations have taken place(3). At the same time, the relocation scheme does not apply to asylum-seekers who arrived in Greece after 20 March 2016, even though the relevant EU decisions do not include a corresponding cut-off date(4). Under the given circumstances, those refugees are stuck in Greece, with all that implies for these suffering people and in turn, for Greece which is already facing hardship.
What steps will the Commission take to ensure that those decisions are fully implemented? 
On what basis does the Commission support not implementing the relocation scheme for refugees who arrived in Greece after 20 March 2016?

The rail link connecting Spain and France is unacceptably problematic between Portbou and Cerbère and requires urgent reform. Despite the time that has elapsed since the Schengen Agreement, this rail link continues to be governed by 19th Century agreements, which make it difficult to cross the border using sustainable transport and without your own vehicle. 
French trains crossing into Spain on the (TER) 2287/5000 Narbonne-Perpignan-Cerbère/Portbou line are not permitted to carry passengers back to France. The same applies for Spanish trains returning to Spain from Cerbère. Furthermore, the train timetables do not offer a good link between these two countries and the new timetables published by SNCF have further reduced the connections. 
It is therefore urgent to improve these links, plan timetables to facilitate connections and create a Euroregional transport network that improves the existing model. 
In view of the fact that the current Portbou-Cerbère rail link breaches the principle of European integration and the advancement of sustainable transport:
1.
Is the Commission aware of this situation?
2.
What measures does it intend to take to remove the existing barriers and enable effective integration between Catalonia and Occitanie?
3.
Will it call on the two Member States to take action?

On a number of occasions it has been demonstrated that many environmental impact assessments do not comply with the objectives originally sought when such studies were made compulsory for projects having environmental implications. Some undertakings which are obliged to submit such studies consider them to be a purely formal requirement - something to be performed by themselves to pay lip-service to the rules.
What is the Commission's assessment of the real usefulness of environmental impact assessments?
Does the Commission consider that these studies are meeting the objectives for which they were introduced?
Does the Commission not believe that it should introduce a proposal on the minimum criteria for environmental impact assessments, established in such a way as to ensure that they will no longer be treated by many as a purely formal requirement?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2001-0792&language=EN,E-0792/01,NA,commission

According to a US study avian influenza virus H5N1 is less fatal than was previously assumed. At the same time, more people may have been infected than were recorded by the World Health Organisation (WHO), according to researchers at the renowned Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. In a study they were able to establish that people in whose blood avian influenza was found did not display any symptoms and that the illness would not necessarily occur. The Americans were therefore critical of the fact that the WHO had overlooked less serious cases of avian influenza.
1. Is the Commission aware of these research findings?
2. Are there any bodies in the EU that re-check the studies published by the WHO?
3. How many people actually fell victim to avian influenza throughout the EU?

The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in Case C-104/ 16 P — Council v Front Polisario that Western Sahara is not part of the sovereign territory of Morocco and that, following the principles of self-determination and of the relative effect of treaties, the EU-Morocco Association and Liberalisation Agreements could not apply to Western Sahara without the consent of the people of Western Sahara.
The latest report of the EU-Morocco Joint Scientific Committee states that EU vessels operating under the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) are mostly fishing in Sahrawi waters. Moreover, the Commission has already stated that the new Protocol to the EU-Morocco FPA applies to Western Sahara waters (E-00/7185/2013) and it has acknowledged that EU vessels fish in Sahrawi waters under this FPA (P-007594/2016 and E‐005487/2016).
Can the Commission clarify what the legal basis is, under international or EC law, for EU vessels to fish in Sahrawi waters under the EU-Morocco FPA?
Did the people of Western Sahara consent to the exploitation of their natural resources?
Does the Commission consider that the EU-Morocco FPA is being implemented in a manner that is compatible with the principles of self-determination and of the relative effect of treaties or EU obligations under international humanitarian law?

The United States Congress recently passed the Dodd-Frank act on financial supervision. Article 1502 of this act orders the drafting of a bill on reporting requirements for conflict minerals (columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, gold, wolframite and their derivatives) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). This law should lead to transparency in trade in so-called ‘conflict minerals’, minerals fuelling and funding the armed struggle in the Eastern DRC that continuously destabilises the region and leads to massive human rights violations such as the recent epidemic of rape on women.
In the joint resolution of 4 October 2010 on failures in protection of human rights and justice in the Democratic Republic of Congo the European Parliament invited the European Commission to follow this US example and draft European legislation on conflict minerals.

In European Union Member States, higher-education diplomas are classified in various different ways. In one country, a professional bachelor’s is equated with graduation from a ‘college’, which counts as a qualification but not as an academic degree, whereas in another it is recognised as a full higher-education certificate, qualifying the holder to proceed with a master’s. Because of such discrepancies, universities in different EU Member States may refuse to accept students from other Member States as if their qualifications were inadequate.
In 2008, the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) began to operate in the European Union, linking different countries’ qualification systems and serving as an instrument for the comparison and clarification of qualifications obtained in different countries, yet so far only seven EU Member States have entered their systems of qualifications in the EQF.
Does the Commission consider that all EU Member States should join the European Qualifications Framework, which would remedy the above discrepancies?

On 11 August 2014, the Commission published a letter criticising the discriminatory online practices employed by six international car rental companies (in particular varying prices depending on the renter's place of residence).

2.
reduce as much as possible waiting times for confirmation of online bookings by service providers, i.e. the time taken to confirm that rental companies have cars available, even though customers have already made a binding booking and have given their personal and tank details, and make online cancellation standard?
3.
clarify the responsibilities of price comparison websites (who act as middlemen between consumers and car rental companies), in particular as regards the confirmation of availability of vehicles which have been booked?

On 3 October 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Commission directive ‘laying down calculation methods and reporting requirements pursuant to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels (FQD)’.
In this directive, the Commission introduces a mandatory reduction target of 6 % by 2020 for the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of fuels used in the EU by road vehicles and non-road mobile machinery.
The directive proposes specific default values for fuel produced from tar sands, which differ from those for fuel obtained from conventional mineral oil. The Commission directive will be adopted using the commitology procedure with scrutiny.
While an impact assessment (IA) of the FQD was undertaken in 2007, it did not address the exact methodology which would be applied to reach the reduction targets. Those measures are now decided through the commitology procedure. The current proposal, if implemented, is expected to have a significant impact on the global competitiveness of EU industry. Furthermore, it may raise questions as regards the EU's reliability as a trading partner and increase the administrative obligations of Member States.
Considering the above, will the Commission undertake an impact assessment taking into account the proposed implementing measures? If not, why not?
According to the Commission's impact assessment guidelines (SEC(2009) 0092), an IA should also carefully consider the economic impact of a particular policy option on the EU's trade policy and its international obligations. As the current proposal has significant international relevance, has the Commission given due consideration to its implications for EU trade policy?

If a taxpayer does not pay a toll to a private motorway concessionary in Portugal, the case is referred to the Tax Authority, with the possibility of withholding tax refunds and seizing bank deposits, wages or other assets.
The concessionary firm and the tax authority treat each unpaid toll as a separate case, which means that the amounts to be paid increase exponentially.
Under Decree Law 25/2006, for example, a taxpayer with 20 unpaid tolls would face 20 forcible recovery cases with 20 fines amounting to 10 times the value of each toll plus 20 administrative charges. Taxpayers wishing to challenge the decision would have to lodge 20 appeals and pay 20 sets of court fees.
Such penalties are clearly out of all proportion to the harm suffered by the concessionary firm.
The time limits for taxpayers to lodge appeals are inappropriate and do not have any suspensory effects. The charging of fines and administrative costs is suspended only in the event that motorists bring the case to court, which means that appeals have to be lodged individually, each incurring a court fee of between EUR 204 and EUR 612.

Austrian universities face a serious problem; increasing numbers of students from other European countries choose to study here, but then leave Austria again on completion of their studies. This problem is particularly acute in medical faculties in Austria: 79% of German and 56% of medical students from other countries turn their back on Austria on completion of their studies (2011-2013). 
Due to this influx of foreign students, a quota has been introduced for medical courses and 20% of places are now reserved for students from other European countries. 
This rule is also seen as a way of stopping the brain drain from Austria; however, the Commission is opposed to this rule on the grounds of alleged discrimination. 
Even the medical councils have warned of massive losses for Austria, as the exodus of newly qualified health professionals is costing Austrian taxpayers around EUR 250 million a year (it costs approx. EUR 400 000 to train a health professional).
1. What advice can the Commission offer to stem this brain drain, especially in the medical field, given that the current solution has only been accepted as an interim measure up to 2016?

The success of the Blue Flag Initiative on the Community's beaches has led to an indisputable improvement with regard to the availability of clean bathing water on the coasts of the EU's Member States.

However, the time has come to demand further that clean bathing water be accompanied by services essential to bathers' comfort, e.g. WC cabins, dressing rooms and other facilities essential to guaranteeing users the minimum services conducive to a comfortable day at the seaside.

As part of its new remit of 20 June 2016, EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia, the Common Security and Defence Policy mission to combat traffickers of migrants in the Mediterranean, has been given the responsibility for training Libyan coastguards — a measure intended, in turn, to bring Libyan territorial waters under tighter control.
Although the international community supports Libya’s Government of National Accord, the country is fragmented, threatened by jihadists and effectively under the grip of various armed militias. This state of instability in Libya means that the European Union must be extremely cautious when it comes to training security operatives. Furthermore, years of conflict have severely eroded the capabilities of the Libyan Navy and Coastguard Service.

As reported by his lawyer, Anwar al-Bunni, Mr Aksam Noaisse, a Syrian citizen born on 28 December 1951, spokesman for the Committee for the Defence of Freedom and Human Rights (CDF) that he created, along with other Syrians, in 1989 and a Member of the World Federation for Human Rights, has been accused by the Syrian authorities of spreading misinformation detrimental to the government and will be tried by the State Security Court.

Noaisse was arrested on 13 April 2004 in the northern port of Latakia after he had presented to the government a petition signed by 7000 Syrian intellectuals seeking the abolition of the emergency laws in place since the Ba'ath party came to power in 1963. Mr Noaisse was seen on 21 April leaving the court room surrounded by two security agents supporting him on both sides. He was dragging his right foot, and his right hand did not move. His family believes that he had suffered a heart attack and that he is being refused treatment or his usual medication.

As a result of his call for the protection of and respect for human rights in Syria, Noaisse was imprisoned for the first time in 1982. Between 1985 and 1989, he was harassed by the military security services. In 1991, again because of his record on protecting human rights in Syria, he was indicted and sentenced to nine years in prison. He was released from prison in 1998.

Given that the Commission participates fully in the Union's endeavours to support political and human rights in Syria on the basis of principles set out in the Barcelona Declaration and, more specifically, through the negotiation of an Association Agreement,

what measures has it taken, or does it intend to take, against the Syrian authorities so as to secure the immediate release of Mr Noaisse?

Will the Commission raise this issue on the margins of the talks on the Association Agreement being held between Syria and the EU?

Checks relating to the ban on the sale and use of animal feed containing animal proteins for ruminants,WRITTEN QUESTION  by Mauro Nobilia (UEN) to the Commission,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2001-0428+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN,16-02-2001,E-0428/2001,1999-2004,2001,12,italy,Union for Europe of the Nations Group,1999-2004_2001_italy_union-for-europe-of-the-nations-group_12.html,134,E-0428_2001,"
Following the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 1986, and of the fact that the disease is spread by the feeding to ruminants of animal meal containing animal proteins, the Commission, in Decision 90/134/EEC(1), made it obligatory for all Member States to notify instances of the disease. In the months and years that followed 1990 many other decisions were adopted aimed at preventing the export and consumption of animals thought to pose a risk.
On 27 June 1994 the Commission adopted Decision 94/381/EC(2), which banned the feeding to ruminants of proteins of animal origin. The recent cases of BSE identified in numerous Member States demonstrate that the ban on the use of animal proteins has not been complied with.
In addition, the Commission spends large sums of money on BSE monitoring programmes aimed at ensuring that potentially suspect meat does not find its way onto the market. It does not appear, however, that any money is spent on promoting stricter checks on the application of the ban on the use of animal proteins in animal feeds for ruminants.
Can the Commission say whether the above information is correct?
Does it intend to check what measures have been introduced by the Member States to give effect to the ban on the sale and distribution of animal feeds containing animal proteins, which, given that they are the only cause of the spread of the disease, must be got rid of completely?
Is it prepared to examine the possibility of providing for increased and more systematic Community-level checking in relation to the ban on the manufacture and use of feeds containing animal proteins, in order to prevent the re-emergence of BSE in the near future?
Does it intend to adopt provisions on the granting of financial aid for monitoring programmes aimed at preventing the sale and use of feeds containing animal proteins?

There are reports which confirm that food quantity and quality in hotspots (places where refugees are fed) is insufficient and very poor.
According to the French organisation Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières — MSF), many of the almost 200 refugees (including a large number of children) who fled from the Boko Haram group to Bama, a city in the north of Nigeria, have unfortunately died of starvation and dehydration. This is only one of many examples.
Even though many private organisations, like MSF, are performing very helpful humanitarian work to solve this problem, it is still not enough. We must ensure that these children get the care they deserve, given that children are one of the most vulnerable groups in our society. It is our job to ensure that human and children's rights are respected.

There is no provision in Italian law for local police officers to be included on registers of workers at risk of industrial disease. Between 1980 and 1996, 180 municipal police officers in active service died in Rome alone, 42% of them from cancer and 40% from cardiopulmonary disease. The average age of death was 51 years. Compared to other workers, on at-risk registers, the death rate for municipal police officers appears to be extremely high and death is almost always caused by diseases contracted in the course of their work on the streets, in contact with harmful atmospheric agents.
Does the Commission not agree that the failure of the Italian government to place local police officers on at-risk registers breaches all the Community laws on health protection?

The disastrous floods which have been devastating Pakistan for almost a month now have resulted in more than 1 500 deaths, leaving at least 500 000 people homeless and affecting more than 17 million people in various ways.
The floods, which have affected one fifth of national territory, destroying crops, fields, property and infrastructure, are being described as the worst disaster for 80 years. Irrigation systems, telecommunications lines, hospitals, roads and bridges have been destroyed. As the waters swallow up ever greater areas, the damage is increasing significantly. As entire crops are wiped out by the floods, farmers will have to rely on food aid to survive the winter.
The affected areas are also threatened with the spread of diseases caused by lack of drinking water, such as diarrhoea, asthma, skin allergies and cholera. According to United Nations estimates, 3.5 million children are at risk from the spread of viral infections. At least ten children have died from gastroenteritis in the camps in Karachi and southern Waziristan, while many others have been hospitalised after drinking infected water in the camps. With six million people without shelter, food and, above all, drinking water, the danger now is of a second death toll much greater than the first. As the wait for humanitarian aid continues, the number of victims increases day by day, especially among the most vulnerable sections of the population. 
Lastly, the humanitarian crisis caused by the floods is in danger of bankrupting the country and playing into the hands of Islamic fundamentalist groups.
International donors have already given USD 500 million. Yet this aid is not sufficient to meet the immediate needs of those affected, nor will it cover the costs of rebuilding the houses, villages and infrastructures destroyed by the floods.

Ses Fontanelles is an environmentally precious wetland located on the island of Palma in the Balearics. This valuable enclave covers around 32.5 hectares but has been left systematically unprotected by the national and autonomous authorities. The failure to protect this site was reported in Question E-011364/2012, in answer to which the Commission stated that it did not intend to take any action against urbanisation plans in the area because Ses Fontanelles was not included in the Natura 2000 network. The non-inclusion of Ses Fontanelles is certainly a glaring omission, since habitat 1510 (Mediterranean salt steppes, Limonietalia) is very scarce in the Balearic Islands, and the area in question is probably the most extensive, continuous and, up until now, best preserved example of it in the entire archipelago. This area is also a key breeding, feeding, passage and wintering site for a whole range of species that are protected under Directive 2009/147/EC (amending the earlier Directive 79/409/EEC) on the conservation of wild birds. More specifically, it is a habitat for the following species listed in Annex I: Ardeola ralloides, Egretta garzetta, Ardea purpurea, Himantopus himantopus and Burhinus oedicnemus. 
Earthmoving work has recently begun for the construction of a large shopping centre on land occupied by the above habitats of Community importance and habitats for strictly protected species. These activities are totally incompatible with the conservation of these natural assets. The case-law established by the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to the application of Directive 2009/147/EC is clear: in its judgment of 2 August 1993 in case C‐355/90, it stressed that priority must be given to ornithological criteria, on the one hand, and the designation of a habitat as a wetland area, on the other. 
1. Is the Commission considering the possibility that Ses Fontanelles could become a site of Community importance (SCI) and be included among the areas protected by the Natura 2000 network?

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán made an official visit to Kazakhstan on 1 April. He said during the visit that Hungarians are aliens in Europe and must turn to the East if they want to feel at home: ‘We are treated as political equals in the European Union, but our origin makes us outsiders. When we go to Brussels, we do not have any relatives there, but when we come to Kazakhstan, we find kinsmen. It is a strange feeling that a person has to travel east to feel at home.’ It is no surprise that a prime minister who has demolished the rule of law and media freedom and dispensed with human rights feels better in the East than in Brussels, since Europe’s fundamental values are not observed there. While on the official visit, the Hungarian prime minister lavished particular praise on Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been in power for 24 years, calling him the ‘cornerstone’ of Kazakhstan’s stability. If the prime minister of an EU Member State thinks so highly of the presidential elections of one of the world’s least democratic countries, the credibility of the EU is also called into question.
— Is the European Commission prepared to respond to the statement made by the Hungarian prime minister in Kazakhstan to the effect that he feels better in the East than in Brussels?

MISKO, the pasta-producing subsidiary of the Italian company Barilla, has received funding under Greek development law 1892/90 to set up a new production plant at Thiva on condition that it maintains the present number of 275 permanent jobs. Before completing construction of the new plant, the company closed down its pasta factory in Patras, compelling the current workforce either to resign or agree to being transferred to other company plants. The workers who agree to be transferred, however, are faced with an expensive relocation bill and they are therefore forced to leave their jobs and run the risk of remaining unemployed.
Is it possible to assist these workers to cover the expense of their enforced relocation? Which programmes and procedures may be used to provide such assistance?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-1999-2779&language=EN,E-2779/99,NA,commission
"VP/HR - The case of Trepca Mining, Kosovo",Question for written answer E-005108/12by Charles Tannock (ECR)to the Commission,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-7-2012-005108_EN.html,21-05-2012,E-005108/2012,2009-2014,2012,30,unitedkingdom,European Conservatives and Reformists Group,2009-2014_2012_unitedkingdom_european-conservatives-and-reformists-group_30.html,500,E-005108_2012,"
Trepca Mining in Kosovo is officially one company under UNMIK/KTA administration, under the authority granted to it by UN Security Council Resolution 1244, and managed by a Trepca International Manager appointed by UNMIK. In reality, since the conflict there are two separate companies: Trepca South (with a Kosovo Albanian management) and Trepca North (with a Kosovo Serbian management). Trepca North has almost 3 500 employees. Since June 2011, Trepca North has come under economic pressure from the Tax Administration of Kosovo by means of the non-refunding of VAT and seizure of bank balances. Trepca North management allege this is a political campaign from Pristina to force closure of a viable business north of the Ibar River and to compel Belgrade to abandon its support for Kosovo Serbs living in northern Mitrovica.
Trepca North was prevented in June 2011 by the Privatisation Agency of Kosovo from exporting its products, by not being provided with customs clearance of its goods, and when drivers of the transporting company were arrested and trucks with goods seized by the police. An additional problem was the prohibition of transfer of civil explosives. The current pragmatic de facto organisational structure that Trepca North has operated under for the past 11 years has been a successful business model, leaving the eventual resolution of the legal status of the company and the ultimate ownership issue (which would lead to a successful restructuring and privatisation) to be part of the current dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, facilitated by the EU.
As EULEX is a civilian CSDP mission which includes participation by the five EU states that do not recognise Kosovo’s independence, does the Vice-President/High Representative agree that EULEX should insist that the Government of Kosovo respect the current working arrangements and cease the economic sanctions against Trepca North allegedly aimed at bringing about the closure of a major source of income and employment amongst Kosovo Serbs in northern Kosovo?",/doceo/document/E-7-2012-005108-ASW_EN.html,E-005108/2012,NA,commission

Possible infringement of Community rules on the protection of employees and employment rates by Tetra Pak's restructuring plan,WRITTEN QUESTION  by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2006-2565+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN,01-06-2006,E-2565/2006,2004-2009,2006,11,italy,Union for Europe of the Nations Group,2004-2009_2006_italy_union-for-europe-of-the-nations-group_11.html,240,E-2565_2006,"


On 26 April 2006 the Swedish multinational, Tetra Pak, announced the launch of a restructuring plan aimed at reorganising its production activities. In particular, it announced the closing of its plant in the Italian province of Latina and the opening of the mobility procedure for 130 employees at the plant. The restructuring plan provides for the Latina establishment’s activities producing Tetra Rex containers to be concentrated in the Sunne plant in Sweden. The grounds given for the decision by the firm’s management were declining consumption, and consequent overproduction, of Tetra Rex, partly caused by strong competition in the food container market. However, the Latina establishment’s accounts are in the black, no losses have been recorded and the decline in output recorded at the Latina plant is lower than average for the sector in Italy and Europe. Moreover, in 2002, the employees contributed to turning the company round by opting for extremely flexible working hours and a 15 % cut in their own salaries, thus enabling the company to invest in research and new technologies. The ‘tax’ on pay agreed for a five-year period is still in force, but the resulting savings will not be reinvested in the region or for the benefit of the employees who have contributed to making them. Despite the readiness already shown by employees, and expressed in recent days by the provincial, regional and national authorities to maintain production and seek solutions to avoid the closure of the plant, Tetra Pak has maintained its unilateral decision to close down the Latina establishment and make 130 employees redundant, which will affect a further 70 workers in related employment. This being so:
1.

Would the Commission state whether Tetra Pak has complied with the provisions of Directive 98/59/EC(1) on collective redundancies, and in particular Article 2 thereof, and whether it has complied with Directive 94/45/EC(2), as amended by Directive 97/74/EC(3), and Directive 2002/14/EC(4)?
2.

Would the Commission state whether it has any data about the alleged crisis in the sector, and if so, whether it corroborates the data cited by the management of Tetra Pak as grounds for closing the establishment?
3.

Would the Commission state what measures could be taken to avoid closing the establishment down and making the employees redundant?

The right to vote in parliamentary elections under universal suffrage is an important and essential democratic right that has been won in European countries. 
Several articles in the EU Treaties acknowledge this basic right and other democratic rights.
Some of these rights include the principle of equality (Article 9 TEU) and the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union (Article 10.3 TEU). The Treaties also place importance on the national parliament in the functioning of the EU (Article 12 TEU),
EU citizens also have the right to move and reside freely within the EU and to provide services based upon a level playing field within the EU. However, when availing themselves of these rights EU citizens can be deprived of their basic right to vote in national parliamentary elections when working or travelling in another Member State.
Does the Commission therefore believe, in the spirit of the aforementioned democratic rights, that EU citizens should have the right to participate in the national parliamentary and other elections of the Member State they are resident in or in their home Member State?",/doceo/document/E-7-2010-6242-ASW_EN.html,E-6242/2010,117,council

Imports from China of solar energy systems marketed at dumping prices are forcing more and more European manufacturers of photovoltaic equipment to declare insolvency or lay off workers.
Against this background, on 25 July 2012 the EU ProSun trade association lodged a complaint with the Commission urging it to begin keeping a formal record of Chinese imports as soon as possible and, if dumping is confirmed, to impose retroactive penalties. On 6 September 2012 the Commission officially opened an anti-dumping investigation, the results of which are expected in mid-to-late 2013.
On 25 September 2012, EU ProSun filed another complaint against the massive subsidies propping up the Chinese solar industry, which breach international trade rules by distorting competition.
Since every week sees another solar energy company forced to declare insolvency or make workers redundant, EU ProSun has called on the Commission to speed up the procedure and begin keeping a formal record of Chinese imports as a matter of urgency.

An increasing number of national industries are unable to adapt their production systems to the new EU requirements in due time, as Member States have not received a clear timeline from the EU for their transposition.
Comitology and delegated acts are designed to enable these measures to be adopted via a fast‐track process. However, the intended fast-track processes are in fact slowing down the full application of EU legislation, creating legal uncertainty for stakeholders and national enterprises. Quite often, the deadlines set for the Commission to transpose EU legislation are very close to the deadlines for Member States to implement that legislation. So industries are not given enough time to adapt their machinery and convert their production systems in accordance with the new EU requirements, leading to high costs and significant economic losses. In some cases this may even lead to a de facto impossibility of complying with EU legislation.
Can the Commission clarify whether it is aware of this situation, and what its position will be if the delayed adoption of delegated and implementing acts makes it impossible for stakeholders and enterprises to fully comply with and implement EU legislation?",/doceo/document/E-8-2014-010370-ASW_EN.html,E-010370-14,130,commission

Following the adoption of the regulation on roaming charges, several telecommunications firms in Denmark have begun to introduce charging by the minute, rather than by the second as in the past. In other words, a conversation lasting one minute and one second will be charged at the rate for two minutes. This is a way for the telecommunications firms to earn the money they used to make from high roaming charges; however, it is a very regrettable consequence of the regulation and is not in the consumer’s interest.

Various media sources have recently picked up on the high volatility in the exchange rate of the virtual currency Bitcoin. Over the last year, the value of the currency has soared by more than 6 000%.
It is not only these fluctuations and their potential consequences that are of concern to me. According to a report published by the European Central Bank in October 2012(1), the system demonstrates a clear case of information asymmetry as ‘[i]t is complex and therefore not easy for all potential users to understand. At the same time, however, users can easily download the application and start using it even if they do not actually know how the system works and which risks they are actually taking’.
Furthermore, as the Commission will be aware, the currency enables transactions to be carried out anonymously. This could greatly help criminal organisations conduct transactions or facilitate access to fraudulent markets(2).

Undoubtedly, and as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, has claimed, virtual currency may hold long-term promise in certain areas. However, in view of all the questions raised:
1.
Does the Commission not think it should launch a detailed study into the consequences of the increased use of this virtual currency?
Despite the fact that the currency has attracted more investors than consumers, various reports(3) in the media indicate a possible change in direction.
2. Does the Commission intend to take any action to protect the consumer?

The Abruzzo Region has delivered a favourable opinion on the plan to build a wastewater treatment plant in the ‘Colle Regina’ area of Abruzzo, on the Pescasseroli plain.
The area in question falls within the Abruzzo National Park, in addition to the Site of Community Interest IT7110205 (Abruzzo National Park), defined as being of high environmental quality with ‘priority’ habitats that are also of archaeological interest owing to the presence of pre-Roman settlements. In addition, the construction will be in Area 119 of the ‘area of importance for the conservation of birds’ programme, i.e. an area considered to be an important habitat for the conservation of bird populations.
The actual work planned will have a significant environmental impact, as it will involve excavations and will cross a river-bed and a rocky ridge, within a ‘unique’ environmental unit in the central Apennines.
Given the above, can the Commission say:
1.
Whether this project is indicative of a permanent decline in an area that should be safeguarded, in accordance with Directives 79/409/EEC (Wild Birds Directive) and 92/43/EEC (Habitats Directive);
2.
What assurances it can provide that all possible alternatives to locate the sewage treatment plant on a more appropriate site have been assessed by the local authorities responsible, with a view to merging the need for waste water treatment with environmental protection?

On 22 October 2014, the Parliament of the Czech Republic passed an amendment to the law on electronic communications. This gave rise to comments by professional users and the Czech Telecommunications Office, pointing out that this would put users in a worse position in relation to telecommunications operators, mainly because it would limit the scope for withdrawing from a contract in the event of a change to the terms and conditions, and also because it would reduce the level of the guaranteed obligation to provide information to users.
There is a suspicion that the amendment is contrary to Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive). This concerns a provision which, in contrast with the legislation as it stands, does not allow the customer to terminate the contract if the operator unilaterally modifies the conditions, but on the contrary forces the customer to remain in a contractual relationship on terms to which he/she does not agree and which may be disadvantageous to him/her. The Universal Service Directive states, on this point, that subscribers have a right to withdraw from their contracts without penalty upon notice of proposed modifications in the contractual conditions.

100% recyclable solar panels,Question for written answer E-005639/12by Sergio Paolo Francesco Silvestris (PPE)to the Commission,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-7-2012-005639_EN.html,05-06-2012,E-005639/2012,2009-2014,2012,37,italy,Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats),2009-2014_2012_italy_group-of-the-european-people-s-party--christian-democrats-_37.html,1001,E-005639_2012,"
Italian-Swedish collaboration has produced a 100 % recyclable photovoltaic module. The new product is the result of a partnership between an Italian photovoltaics manufacturing company, which has 10 years’ experience in the supply of complete solar panel systems, and a Swedish start-up that specialises in developing thin-film deposition technologies.
The idea is based on depositing a thin layer of CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) film on steel cells. CIGS technology is already used for thin-film panels, and the innovation lies in using a surface smaller than a standard photovoltaic cell (156 x 156 mm) for the expensive deposition process. The heart of the innovation is the assembly process. A new machine has been developed to weld the CIGS cells to make the panels, and a new ‘inverse’ lamination process has been invented for manufacturing the ultra-thin glass.
The CIGS cells are sealed in a thermoplastic film that adheres to the glass and provides insulation from atmospheric agents for 30 years. This material not only ensures performance above the current standard, but, most importantly, is free from acetic acids and enables the process to be reversed at high temperatures. Hence, when a panel has reached the end of its life, it can be opened and all the materials inside (glass, aluminium, metals, etc.) can be reused, with essentially no environmental impact. 

In view of the above:
1.
Does the Commission know about the new 100 % recyclable photovoltaic module?
2.
Has Parliament approved any regulations on separate waste collection and recycling as regards solar panels?

On 8 July 2010, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso received a letter from EP President Jerzy Buzek in which he requested the Commission’s view on the initiative of declaring 25 May the European Day honouring the Heroes of the Fight against Totalitarianism. 
The proposed date is symbolic because it was on 25 May 1948 that Witold Pilecki, a Polish soldier who volunteered to be sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to set up a resistance movement and gather information for the Allies about Nazi atrocities committed inside the camp, was executed by the Polish Communist authorities.
The proposal was submitted by the ECR Group upon the initiative of Michał Tomasz Kamiński and Tomasz Poręba.

Proposal for a CMO in potatoes based on a specific system of surface area quotas,WRITTEN QUESTION  by Josu Imaz San Miguel (PPE) to the Commission,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-1994-2658+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN,14-12-1994,E-2658/1994,1994-1999,1994,3,spain,Group of the European People's Party (Christian-Democratic Group),1994-1999_1994_spain_group-of-the-european-people-s-party--christian-democratic-group-_3.html,58,E-2658_1994,"
A market as unstable as that of the potato needs to be regulated at European level, particularly since it is increasingly being grown as an alternative crop, because of production restrictions on other agricultural products, owing to the spread of quota arrangements, and this could exacerbate the problems of potato-growers.
The Commission proposal for a Council Regulation on the common organization of the market in potatoes (COM(92) 185 final)(1) is opposed by some, because they consider that its implementation could inter alia entail greater Community expenditure, complicate administrative formalities and/or interfere with the free development of the market.
The Council of Ministers of 18 and 19 July 1994 agreed to continue its deliberations on the establishment of a CMO in potatoes with a view to adopting a Decision by 1 July 1995.
The new CMO should be compatible with the general regulation of other agricultural products which compete with potatoes despite the fact that the problems which gave rise to the present arrangements for these products (the lack of control over EAGGF Guarantee expenditure) and the problems affecting potatoes are different, and efforts should be made to avoid the usual problems which beset the CAP.
The introduction of a specific system of surface area quotas in the proposal for a CMO in potatoes could provide a flexible general framework to regulate supply without complex administration or increased expenditure and the dynamics of the market itself would lead to a stable, efficient and fair functioning of the market.
Could the Commission consider including such a system of surface area quotas in a new proposal for a Regulation on the establishment of a CMO in potatoes?

On 11 June 2009 the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a pandemic caused by the spread of the H1N1 virus, commonly known as ‘swine flu’.
One year on from this declaration of a state of alert, conclusions have been drawn by two documents: an investigation published by the British Medical Journal, which shook public opinion by calling into question the transparency of the findings of the WHO task force on the dangerousness of the virus in question, and a report by Mr Paul Flynn, MP, on the WHO's behaviour in managing the new H1N1 influenza. Mr Flynn declared before the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe that the vaccination programme set up by the WHO was nothing but ‘placebo medicine on a large scale’.
The only certainty appears to be that thanks to the race by governments all over the world to stockpile vaccines, the pharmaceutical companies have earned at least USD 7 billion, according to estimates by the bank J.P. Morgan. 
Can the Commission say how many deaths were officially ascribed to the H1N1 virus in Poland?
Can the Commission say how many doses of vaccine were purchased by Poland and how many were actually used?

As the Commissioner announced on 5 July 2016, the trade agreement between the EU and Canada must be voted on by the national parliaments of the 28 Member States before it can be definitively adopted. This announcement followed on from one made by the President of the Commission, who declared on 29 June 2016 that the agreement came within the exclusive competence of the EU and was not a ‘mixed agreement’, meaning that there was no requirement to consult the national parliaments.
The final decision to declare the agreement a mixed agreement is a response to a legal analysis, on the one hand, and the people's desire to be consulted on issues that concern them on the other. Despite this, however, it seems that the agreement could enter into force provisionally — before any national parliament has been consulted — once adopted by the European Parliament.

By letter published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (1) the Commission informed the Spanish Government of its decision to extend the procedure concerning aid to publicly-owned shipyards.
The above text refers to the notification by the Spanish authorities of 31 December 1994 to the effect that Astander (Astilleros de Santander shipyard) would continue its activities of ""repair and conversions"" and would cease building new vessels while it remains a public yard.
On what arguments does the Commission base its view that the problem of reducing the capacity of publicly-owned Spanish shipyards would be resolved through the hypothetical cessation of ""conversion"" activities at Astander?
How did the Commission arrive at its interpretation that building and conversion are activities which can be dealt with jointly, to the detriment of the Astander company and its workers?

The approval of the State Aid Scheme for the Madeira Free Trade Zone (FTZ) is covered by Article 349 of the TFEU, under which the Union shall adopt specific measures in particular areas such as fiscal policy and free zones. The objective of the Madeira FTZ is to attract investment to and create jobs in Madeira.
The outermost regions have permanent disadvantages with a combination of factors restraining their development and growth. Last month, the Commission opened an in-depth investigation to examine whether Portugal has applied the Madeira Free Trade Zone regional aid scheme in conformity with Commission decisions.
In view of this:
—
How does the Commission, when launching this type of procedure, try to avoid potential losses to the affected region related to its image and to perceptions of confidence and security on the part of potential investors and those who have chosen to settle in the region?
—
Has the Commission carried out a general overview of the impact of the state aid measure in the region?
—
Since the Madeira authorities claim to have used the aid scheme viewing it as a comprehensive and competitive measure designed to tackle the permanent weaknesses and handicaps of the regional economy in a context of increasing and irreversible globalisation, what alternative means does the Commission propose for achieving this goal on the basis of a credible economic policy and the corresponding efficacy?

The independence of central banks is essential in modern monetary systems. It is the guarantee that policymakers will not use monetary policy in a distorting way. At the same time, central banks are accountable for their policies to the public.
The Hungarian government and the governor of the Hungarian National Bank (MNB), however, consistently betrayed the principles of independence and accountability of the central bank when they channelled public money to people close to them via the central bank's foundations.
The six foundations belonging to the MNB were financing projects in areas outside the scope of their official activities, while ignoring public procurement and transparency laws. In addition, they were engaged in state financing activities under the direct control of the governor of the MNB. These suspicious activities have not gone unnoticed, as the European Central Bank has already expressed its reservations. However, after the foundations' spending was made public following a court decision, it became clear that the bank was indeed involved in illegal monetary financing.
Given the accumulated evidence that the MNB and its foundations have violated the EU's public procurement directive and have been engaged in monetary financing of a prohibited nature, will the Commission start an investigation to clarify the case?",/doceo/document/P-8-2016-003735-ASW_EN.html,P-003735-16,130,commission

Council Directive 89/618/Euratom of 27 November 1989(1) on informing the general public about health protection measures to be applied and steps to be taken in the event of a radiological emergency states the following in its Article 5:

1. Member States shall ensure that the population likely to be affected in the event of a radiological emergency is given information about the health protection measures applicable to it and about the action it should take in the event of such an emergency.

2. The information supplied shall at least include the elements set out in Annex I.

3. This information shall be communicated to the population referred to in paragraph 1 without any request being made.
The Italian government incorporated the directive by means of Legislative Decree No 230 of 17 March 1995, but made its implementation partly conditional on the appearance of further legislation which has not materialised to date.

In practice, no preventive information has been supplied to those likely to be affected in the event of a radiological emergency. This has recently been confirmed by the local representatives of the Italian government in Vercelli.

This failure to provide preventive information is quite unjustifiably increasing the risks attached to such emergencies: the public is not properly prepared and is therefore not in a position to take the appropriate measures.

This failure to act on Italian territory runs counter to the spirit of the intervention plans for nuclear emergencies, as has been made clear following accidents at several nuclear power stations and others occurring with the transport of highly radioactive substances — as with the measures now under way to transfer part of the irradiated nuclear fuel from the Saluggia nuclear storage plant (Vicenza, Italy) to the Sellafield treatment plant in the UK.

Is it aware of this serious omission?
2.

What action does it intend to take to ensure that Italy implements the legislation on preventive information of the population in good and due form, given that thirteen years have elapsed since the adoption of Directive 89/618?
3.

Does it not consider it desirable to call on the Italian government to suspend all new nuclear activities until it has complied with its obligations regarding prevention?

2003 Amnesty - Campania,Question for written answer E-005435/2018to the CommissionRule 130Fulvio Martusciello (PPE),https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2018-005435_EN.html,24-10-2018,E-005435/2018,2014-2019,2018,3,italy,Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats),2014-2019_2018_italy_group-of-the-european-people-s-party--christian-democrats-_3.html,193,E-005435_2018,"
Decree Law 269/03, converted into Law 326/03, is intended by the legislator to apply to the whole of Italy, and provides an amnesty for self-build projects completed by 31 March 2003, in order to address the difficult living conditions in which millions of people find themselves, and who are in dire need of housing.
By ignoring national laws, the Campania Region has failed — with the Regional Council’s Decision No 2827/03 then with Regional Law No 10/2004 — to apply this amnesty in its jurisdiction, by obliging local administrators and/or managers to negate the effects of State laws.
In Judgment No 199/04 and Judgment No 49/06, the Constitutional Court deemed both regional provisions to be constitutionally unlawful, pointing out that national laws are applicable to all Italian regions.
Due to these regional legislative measures, the residents of Campania are subject to unfair and unjust treatment compared with the rest of Italy, as they are not able to benefit from the amnesty, since the deadline for submission of amnesty applications has now expired.
Does the Commission therefore not agree that:
The conditions faced by the residents of Campania are blatantly discriminatory, and that they undermine the principle of equality, which is the very basis of democracy upon which the EU is founded?

The PNVD party (Party of Neighbourly Love, Freedom, and Diversity, referred to below as the ‘PNVD’) was founded in the Netherlands on 30 May 2006. The PNVD is aiming, among other things, to liberalise child pornography and sexual relations between adults and children and to lower the age of consent from 16 to 12. On 17 July 2006 a court in The Hague ruled against a petition to prevent the PNVD being set up. The party’s policy goals — which the Dutch Government has described as utterly despicable — are contrary to the standard-setting principles laid down in conventions, protocols, and declarations on the rights of the child and prevention of abuse and sexual exploitation of children that have been signed and ratified by all the EU Member States, the Netherlands included. The incompatibility is especially glaring in the light of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted in New York in 1989, which in Article 19 requires States Parties to take legislative, administrative, social, and educational measures to protect children from all forms of physical violence, including sexual abuse, and in Article 34 stipulates that they must do everything appropriate to prevent children being induced to engage, or coerced into engaging, in any unlawful sexual activity. It is a worrying fact that what is happening in the Netherlands might set a dangerous precedent posing a real risk of incitement to unlawful acts and offences against children in Union countries.

What steps will the Council take in this matter? Furthermore, if the PNVD were to contest elections and some of its members were to be elected to the Dutch Parliament, would this not constitute a breach of Article 6 TEU, according to which ‘The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States’? If that were the case, and given what has occurred in the past in similar circumstances, does the Council believe that it could apply measures to the Netherlands as provided for in Article 7 TEU?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=P-2006-3804&language=EN,P-3804/06,NA,council

While the 2013 ban on selling cosmetics tested on animals should be implemented without delay for ethical reasons, irrespective of the availability of alternative non-animal tests, it is also important that non-animal methods are introduced as soon as possible, and that their development is prioritised.
An alternative method can replace a relevant animal test only if ECVAM, the European Centre for Validation of Alternative Methods, has previously validated it. However, it seems that if ECVAM or the OECD fail to validate methods for the replacement of animal tests in time, EU legislation that aims at replacing the use of animals in safety testing cannot come into force (e.g. Cosmetics Directive).

On 3 June 2013, the Washington Post reported that preparations are under way in Afghanistan for the 2014 presidential elections. The current president, Hamid Karzai, has been in office since 2002 when he took over the transitional administration. In 2014, NATO troops are planning to leave the country and it is regarded as crucial by the international community that whoever takes over can ensure stability in the country.
There are concerns that President Karzai is reluctant to hand over power, even though he has said that Afghanistan should not have to undergo political ‘experiments’ every few years, as he does not want to be held to account for any wrongdoings that occurred during his administration, and others claim he believes he is indispensable as President for the country’s future. Karzai has reportedly either obstructed or delayed several electoral reforms which are essential for ensuring a fair election process, such as having an electronic voter ID card. He has also yet to appoint new members to the National Election Commission.
There are reportedly plenty of new candidates prepared to run in the elections, such as former and current cabinet members, Afghan-American businessmen. Even Karzai’s brother Qayum has put himself forward as a candidate. The issue at stake is that many of the candidates will try to compete on the basis that they control clans and militias.
In 2012, under the Instrument for Stability, the EU gave EUR 10 million to Afghanistan to help the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission develop and consolidate capacity for future elections.

The 1996 P v S and Cornwall County Council (C 13/94) judgment by the European Court of Justice affirmed that the principle of equal treatment between women and men enshrined in ‘the directive [76/207/EEC] precludes dismissal of a transsexual for a reason related to a gender reassignment’. Since then, this decision has been included as a guiding principle in the scope of the Gender Goods and Services Directive (2004/113/EC, OJ L 373, 21.12.2004), Recital 3 of the Gender Recast Directive (2006/54/EC, OJ L 204, 26.7.2006), and has guided the inclusion of gender identity under the European Union Strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015.
However, in spite of the above legislative framework, transgender people remain one of the communities facing the most discrimination within the European Union. In its 2010 report Homophobia, transphobia and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, the Fundamental Rights Agency stated:
‘While there is evidence to suggest that there is (albeit slow) progress towards better understanding of issues surrounding gender identity, this does not necessarily translate into improvements in the position of transgender people. They remain a marginalised and victimised group, which faces a high degree of stigmatisation, exclusion, and violence.’ (p. 13)

The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has proved to be useful since it was launched in the context of the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union.
However, the sustainability of the EU ETS could be threatened by the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Indeed, the recently unveiled draft Brexit agreement cryptically notes that the UK plans to put in place a carbon pricing system that is ‘at least as efficient’ as that in the EU ETS.
This wording has been worryingly unclear for the markets, leading to an 8% drop in the price of greenhouse gas emission allowances. This disturbing decline could signal a slump in the European carbon market, as industry professionals fear a massive sale of UK allowances in the run-up to Brexit, which would lead to a collapse of the carbon credit price in Europe.
In light of the above, can the Commission:
1.
Clarify the provisions on the EU ETS contained in the draft agreement with the UK?
2.
Propose a solution to stabilise carbon credit prices in the case of a hasty sale of British holdings?

According to official data of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (the annual ‘ERGANI’ IT system report), 20.4% of Greek workers receive gross wages of no more than EUR 500, while about 35% receive up to EUR 700. This has led to an explosion in the number of the working poor in Greece and reduced to poverty many Greek households which typically have only member who is in employment, due, inter alia, to the soaring unemployment rate. In this connection, and given the EU’s declared objective of boosting employment and reducing poverty, will the Commission say:
1.
How does it evaluate the current situation on the Greek labour market, and its impact both on social cohesion and on the real economy?
2.
Does it have any statistics on wage levels in Member States and relevant comparisons regarding the national poverty thresholds?
3.
The rapid decline in wages in Greece, coupled with the continuing high prices for private facilities for reconciling work and family life (e.g. crèches) and the paucity of corresponding state facilities, is creating powerful disincentives for people seriously to seek for work which in turn militates against a rise in employment. How does it view this fact in light of the fundamental objective of the Europe 2020 strategy of increasing the employment rate to 75%?
4.
How can the full flexibilisation of the labour market in Greece be squared with a massive contraction in wages?

On 17 March 2015, UN investigators announced that they would share names and details of persons suspected of war crimes in Syria with national authorities preparing cases. The lists compiled are said to include both Syrian military and security officials and rebel commanders.
The inquiry has called for Syria to be referred to the ICC, but has recommended that if that avenue is blocked an international ad hoc tribunal should be proposed.

In Spain the situation suffered by some pets, such as dogs, is especially serious. As well as being the country with the most abandoned pets and the growth in illegal breeding establishments, there is a lack of transparency which undermines the legality of their slaughter and encourages extermination.
Owing to the lack of resources in Member States and the legislative differences between them, as recognised by the Commission (COM(2012)0006), there is a need for EU legislation on the protection of pets which contains certain minimum standards applicable in all States. 
1. Does the Commission believe it is necessary to adopt legislation at EU level for the protection of pets throughout the Union, as already expressed by the European Parliament in 2012?
2. Does the Commission intend to adopt the legislation and measures required in order to promote the zero euthanasia of pets in the Union and to encourage adoptions and sterilisation, as well as drawing up campaigns to raise awareness of responsible pet ownership, reintroducing programmes such as CAROdog?

Recent governments of Myanmar/Burma have enacted abusive laws, enforced poorly conceived policies and encouraged corrupt land administration officials, leading to the displacement of small-scale farmers and rural villagers.

Although precarious work has long been an important topic, the current economic and financial crisis has placed the focus on precarious work, and the issue of women especially in precarious employment has become very urgent. In this context, precarious work is a persistent characteristic of the labour market in the European Union, and women are most affected by this job insecurity.
Precarious work is not only a significant cause of the pay gap between women and men, but it is also an obstacle to career prospects which would lead to better jobs and professional development.

Fikru Maru, a Swedish citizen of Ethiopian origin and one of Sweden’s leading heart surgeons, has been arbitrarily detained in Ethiopia since May 2013. He has been at Hudiksvalls hospital in Sweden since 2012, and founded Ethiopia’s first specialist cardio-vascular hospital with funding from Swedfund, a venture capital firm run by the Swedish state for investments in developing countries.
On a visit to Ethiopia in 2010, Fikru Maru was stopped at customs carrying medical equipment, and asked to pay bribes in order to pass. He refused to pay, which later led to his arrest, but the charges were then dropped. In connection with a state inquiry into corruption involving Ethiopia’s customs minister, Fikru Maru and a number of others were taken into custody in May 2013 for allegedly having bribed the customs minister to drop the charges levelled against him in 2010.
Since that time, Fikru Maru’s fundamental right to a fair and speedy trial has not been upheld. And although he has been detained for more than three years, no court has yet ruled on the case.

These spurious and defamatory accusations, which have also been made against the Cyprus Writers' Union and in particular against its chairman, Andreas Kannaouros, constitute a flagrant violation of fundamental freedoms with the aim of intimidating journalists, curbing freedom of expression in the occupied part of Cyprus and, more specifically, compelling Mr Kannaouros to abandon his fight for press freedom and silencing the newspaper ""Avrupa"" and its journalists.

Sardinia Gold Mining was a mining company whose management of mining waste materials had always been criticised by the courts and had been the subject of judicial investigation, because much of this waste had been used for filling in a flyover (State Road 131) that served as a main traffic artery for the entire island.

The Commission proposal on the new COM provides for the possibility of importing grape must from third countries and using it to make wine.

This would amount to a serious threat to winemaking in Sicily and the Mediterranean in general, and would also be in clear contradiction with the policy guidelines of the Commission which, on the one hand, is calling on Italian winegrowers to limit production and, on the other hand, is urging the Community to open up to the production of third countries.

Moreover, such non-Community production entitles users in the Member States to be recognized as ""producers"" for all purposes and hence to benefit from the same aid as producers who use grapes grown in the Community.


What steps does the Commission intend to take:
1.

to ensure that grape must from non-Community countries is not imported into Italy, thereby further penalizing Italian agriculture, whose wine sector can be said to symbolize Mediterranean production?
2.

to take to ban the current practice in some countries of enriching grape must by adding sucrose?

1. Is the Commission aware that the way in which citizens of the 10 new Member States that acceded to the EU in 2004 are being recruited to jobs in the 15 old Member States is causing a growing outcry among citizens of the latter, as they are not being consistently employed on the basis of the laws in force in the Member States or collective bargaining agreements? Is the Commission aware that this means that low pay and poor working conditions are becoming a competitive factor and that workers employed under normal conditions are losing their jobs or coming under pressure to accept cuts in pay and less favourable employment conditions?

2. Is the Commission aware that this problem particularly applies to individuals with ‘self‑employed’ status, which is being deliberately misused as a way of getting people who are in reality employees to work for considerably lower pay?

4. Are the current Member States only able to protect their internal employment conditions by continuing to make use of the possibility of keeping their employment market closed to newcomers until 2011 and by opposing the admission of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 or 2008 and at a later stage that of the former Yugoslav Republics of Croatia and Macedonia and Turkey, which have the status of candidate countries?

This week, Mallorcan rapper Valtònyc was sentenced to three and a half years in jail by the Spanish Supreme Court for exaltation of terrorism and slander against the Crown in his song lyrics(1). 
Earlier this week, a court ordered copies of a book entitled ‘Fariña’, which reveals the relationship between drug traffickers and certain politicians, to be seized and its printing and sales to be halted(2), and an art piece on political prisoners in Spain was withdrawn from the ARCO art exhibition(3). Rapper Pablo Hasél, accused of slander against the Crown and the state, is also awaiting the outcome of his trial and could be sent to prison(4).
The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Article 490 of the Spanish Criminal Code, which protects certain institutions against public offence, is not in line with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This article remains unchanged and constitutes the legal basis for the abovementioned rulings.

Under Council Regulation 3254/91, the use of leghold traps has been illegal since 1991. In a number of Member States such a ban has been in place even longer. Despite the ban on the use of leghold traps at both the national and the European levels, the sale of imported products based on the capture of live animals with leghold traps still takes place.
1. Does the Commission consider there may be a legal basis within current European legislation to stop the import of products which, under European law, are produced with an illegal and/or inadequate attitude to the safeguarding of animal welfare, such as fur products made from animals captured with the use of leghold traps?
2. If this is not the case, does the Commission propose to put forward new legislation in this area which would make such a ban possible?

The Commission has presented its proposal for a regulation establishing technical measures to correct the situation of certain populations of highly migratory species.
Amongst other things the regulation incorporates the 1998 and 1999 ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) recommendations on restricting fishing capacity or effort in respect of albacore tuna by limiting the number of vessels which will in future be allowed to fish to the average recorded during the 1993-1995 period.
Given that the current fishing season's activity in this fishery has already commenced, it can be assumed that the Commission has received the relevant data from each of the Member States involved and has checked and validated it with a view to establishing the average number of vessels authorised in the 1993-1995 period, on the basis of which it was to fix the maximum number of vessels authorised to fish in 2000.
Can the Commission supply the total annual figures for each EU Member State with regard to the number of vessels authorised to fish and actually doing so continually and to the full extent in the albacore fishing seasons in the North Atlantic in each year of the reference period, i.e. in 1993, 1994 and 1995?
What is the average established for each Member State with regard to vessels authorised to fish for albacore and actually doing so continually during the period 1993 to 1995?

An investigation into the effectieveness and efficiency of the EU structural funds by a Financial Times team in collaboration with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism of City University London came to the conclusion that the structural funds system is too bureaucratic and that the money is taken up mainly by large corporations and well-off beneficiaries.
An article of 30 November 2010 in the daily Die Presse under the headline ‘EU study: A lot in the wrong hands, not much in the right’ reports that ‘instead of supporting small and medium-sized undertakings, money goes to corporations such as IBM, Fiat, Nokkia, Siemens, H&M or Coca Cola. Other companies received funds when they were moving their factories to countries with cheaper workforces. EUR 1.6 million was paid out to British American Tobacco for a cigarette factory, although at the same time millions are being spent on anti-smoking campaigns. The structural funds programme has become an opaque bureaucracy, the critics say. Organised crime repeatedly gets its hands on EU aid without difficulty. And the underdeveloped regions that the programme is supposed to help get little because in times of economic crisis their national governments cannot afford to provide the co‑financing required.’

There is still a major disparity between different EU Member States (and between regions within the same) with regard to the availability and quality of the networks linking cultural institutions, schools, universities and different scientific and cultural centres. For remoter, non-interconnected and thinly-populated regions, this involves tremendous costs.

For example, Portugal, which, located in a remote corner of the EU, has difficulties in building a proper network of this kind, has requested to use the Structural Funds to this end. We could also cite thinly-populated Slovenia, where the per capita cost to the taxpayer is greater than in most Member States.

The DG REGIO, by means of its Structural Funds, makes possible the part-funding of these e-infrastructures, but the truth of the matter is that in the countryside there are very few educational institutions.

Does the Commission not think that it would be useful to set up some funds directly designed to fund projects of this kind in order to promote these networks, and thus make progress to achieving genuine ‘freedom of knowledge’ within the EU?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2008-2265&language=EN,E-2265/08,NA,commission

Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world’s oldest bank, which is quoted on the Stock Exchange and active, as well as in Italy, on European and international markets, is at the centre of a scandal involving dubious trading on the derivatives market, which, in addition to causing mass selling of the bank’s shares, is giving rise to immense anxiety among current-account holders and its employees, of whom there are about 30 000.
On 17 December 2012 the Commission, acting under EU State aid rules, temporarily approved a EUR 3.9 billion recapitalisation of Monte Paschi in order to preserve the stability of the Italian financial system and enable the bank to comply with the recommendations of the European Banking Authority. The approval is subject to a requirement to submit a restructuring plan by May 2013.
In his State of the Union Address on 12 September 2012 the Commission President, José Manuel Barroso, had this to say about banks: ‘when things went wrong, it was the taxpayers who had to pick up the bill’.
Today the Monte Paschi scandal is proving the truth of that assertion.
In the light of the foregoing:
1.
Can the Commission explain why the recapitalisation was temporarily approved when there had been no proper analysis of the bank’s financial stability or its use of derivative financing?
2.
Does it believe that checks should be built into the agreement on Europe-wide banking supervision in order to avert further cases of this kind, especially where the derivatives market is concerned?
3.
What information was given to Monte Paschi current-account holders to help protect their savings?

According to press reports, the ruling military junta in Burma (now called Myanmar), which is headed by General Khin Nyunt, has sentenced to death Zaw Thet Htway, aged 37, the editor of the sports magazine First Eleven.

Zaw Thet Htway is alleged to have conspired, along with colleagues, to assassinate the leaders who are oppressing that country through their dictatorial regime. No official warrant was issued for the journalists' arrest and their trial was conducted without the assistance of any lawyers not subject to pressure or external influence and without international observers, who could have guaranteed if not a fair trial then at least one that reflected the fundamental principles of justice. Zaw Thet Htway and the eight other defendants were sentenced to death and confined to a special prison.

All these people have done is to voice a critical opinion of the regime led by General Khin Nyunt by denouncing the misdeeds, abuses and harassment which the people of Burma have been suffering for too long now. The members of this dictatorship have, in fact, over the years, spirited away international donations to the value of several million dollars which were actually intended for the world of sport, to construct and renovate facilities, purchase sports equipment and clothing, and promote football throughout the country.

The military government, on the other hand, has gone so far as to appropriate funds earmarked for sport, without the merest fraction of the money received being allocated to the ends for which it was intended, in order to maintain the current system, which is corrupt, repressive and flies in the face of the most fundamental democratic principles.

In practice, a criticism and negative opinion of this corrupt system has been transformed into an 'illegal' conspiracy against the state, and therefore one punishable by death.

Will the Commission use the powers conferred upon it to intervene to ensure the suspension and revocation of this death sentence, thereby saving the lives of the nine accused, and to safeguard the most fundamental principles of civilisation and democracy that should be applied to all citizens of a democratic nation, in line with the dictates of the European Union?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2004-0099&language=EN,E-0099/04,NA,commission

1. Is the Commission aware that the possible further development of the ‘Plaza’ logistics platform near Zaragoza will, if the Zaragoza-Toulouse rail line is not built in time, above all lead to a further increase in HGV traffic on the two major trans‑border road links between Spain and France that are open all year round, at Irún/Hendaye in the west and Jonquera/Le Perthus in the east, and that these links, which are already suffering from traffic jams, will become completely blocked?

2. How great is the risk that, if the rail link desired by the Spanish side does not go ahead, a motorway running through the Pyrenees in the Aspe valley, partly paid for from funding for trans-European networks, would attract the large volume of freight transport expected to be generated between Zaragoza and Toulouse, leading to this transport being carried out in a way which would have an unnecessarily negative impact on the environment? Would a possible alternative be to bring the French railway line running between the border town of Canfranc in the Pyrenees and Pau (Somport), which has been closed for a long time, back into use, and could this save costs?

3. How does the Commission view the Spanish plans within the context of short sea shipping measures and improvements to the existing rail infrastructure on the Mediterranean and Atlantic sides, including from the point of view of cost‑benefit aspects?

4. Does Spanish opposition to higher toll charges for road freight transport (Eurovignette) play a part in the Commission's assessment of the contribution to be made by the EU to possible solutions to the anticipated traffic congestion?

5. Does the Commission agree that, as a result of a lack of coordination between decisions taken by the Spanish and French sides, there is the risk of investments going wrong, unnecessarily large new traffic flows being created and a serious threat being posed to the environment?

6. Does the Commission consider that it has a role to play in providing advice to the Member States, regions and local authorities concerned regarding positive solutions, facilitating cross-border coordination and advising against unsound or unrealistic plans, or is it adopting a wait-and-see attitude to these projects failing and new problems being caused?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2006-3237&language=EN,E-3237/06,NA,commission

On 20 March 2002 the Commission published an invitation to submit expressions of interest in the Sixth Framework Programme of Research (FP6). Until 7 June 2002, scientific institutes and businesses could submit plans to the Commission for assessment as to their suitability for support from the Framework Programme. On 4 October 2002 the Commission published the results.

From the published results it emerges that in 1997 expressions of interest were submitted for the thematic priority ""Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology"". This priority includes financial support for stem cell research.

The regulation of human embryonic stem cell research is subject to subsidiarity in Europe, and different practices exist in the Member States in this regard. In some Member States, for example, it is permitted to produce human embryos for research purposes, whereas in other Member States this is explicitly prohibited.

Under the compromise reached between the Council and the European Parliament in September 2002 concerning the five specific programmes within the FP, it was agreed that until the end of 2003 the Commission should not finance any research programmes which included embryonic stem cell research.

In recent years the leading European industrialised nations have made progress in terms of protecting, respecting, and preserving animal rights by adopting Community legislation to regulate the hunting and conservation of protected species such as the wolf.
Sweden has passed an Act of Parliament allowing wolves to be legally hunted until 15 February.
Conferring legitimacy in this way could encourage poaching, with the risk that entire populations of endangered species might be drastically reduced.

Member States had until 13 March to react to the draft UK ban on fur-farming. Five Member States (Italy, France, Finland, Spain and Denmark) voiced very serious concerns about the measure, and France submitted a detailed opinion opposing its adoption. As the Commission is aware, this proposal has no scientific basis (nor does the UK claim that it has), and the justification put forward for it by the UK authorities is public morality.
As the Commission is aware, fur-farming is a well regulated sector of agriculture governed by national and EU laws as well as by a Council of Europe Recommendation on fur animals which was adopted in June 1999 with the support of all EU Member States and the Commission. The EU is the largest producer of farmed fur, and the sector provides thousands of jobs, both directly and indirectly.
In view of this situation, does not the Commission consider it illogical and incorrect for a Member State to ignore EU laws governing a legitimate agricultural activity and ban it without full and proper justification? Is not the Commission concerned about the precedent that would be set if a ban based on unsubstantiated public morality arguments were accepted, and is it not worried that the same basis might be used to ban the keeping of other farmed animals or to introduce measures on the transport of animals that conflict with EU directives in this field?
Finally, in the light of the above, does not the Commission consider that it should take a position against the draft UK ban as a matter of urgency and join France in issuing a detailed opinion?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2000-1512&language=EN,E-1512/00,NA,commission

On 12 April 2012, in Vietnam, a Christian pastor was the victim of a vicious assault by armed attackers, who not only beat the cleric but also destroyed the orphanage he had opened, and threatened workers and children. From the evidence available, it appears that local police and authorities colluded in this attack, with the police being present at the site specifically in order to keep Christians away and ensure that the attack was successfully concluded. Calls from the Bishop of Hanoi for an investigation to be opened into the matter have been ignored.

On 29 April 2013, after participating in the open tender procedure and offering the most financially advantageous bid for designing and constructing Sofia’s high-speed northern bypass (from 0+000 km to 16+540 km), the Salini‐Impregilo joint venture had received notification of being awarded the contract (ARI Decision No 52/29.4.2013) by the Bulgarian Agency for Roads and Infrastructure (ARI) for the highest score achieved, based on the technical proposal and implementation times envisaged.
As a result of an appeal lodged by two of the other participants, Porr Bau GmbH (Austria) and the HPVS‐SST consortium (Bulgaria), the Bulgarian Commission for the Protection of Competition (CPC) announced on 19 June 2013 that it upheld the appeal from the HPVS‐SST consortium, while disqualifying the Salini‐Impregilo joint venture based on its alleged failure to meet the following tender requirements:
—
demonstrating that the experience of the specialists being put forward for the project manager and assistant project manager positions was equivalent to a master's degree in ‘Transport construction/Engineering’;
—
 demonstrating the necessary work experience for the position of health and safety coordinator.
The company maintains that it supplied all the necessary documentation to prove the requirements were met.
In light of the above, can the Commission answer the following questions:
1.
Is it true that the infrastructure in question will be constructed using funds coming from the European Union’s budget?
2.
If this is the case and given the suspected illegitimate nature of the decisions made by the Bulgarian Agency for Roads and Infrastructure (ARI) on this matter, what audit checks does the Commission intend to carry out to ensure that European funds are used properly, efficiently and effectively?
3.
Furthermore, does the Commission believe that the European directives on public procurement have been infringed, given that the principles of transparency and non-discrimination seem to have been disregarded?
4.
Finally, does it also believe that European law on professional qualifications has been infringed, given the refusal to recognise the specialists who have all the necessary attributes?

Acquedotto Pugliese is planning to build an underwater outfall to discharge wastewater from the treatment plants serving the localities of Bisceglie, Corato, Molfetta, Ruvi di Puglia, and Terlizzi. 
This project is also considered necessary in order to ensure that wastewater is conveyed to its final destination, even when there is no demand for irrigation.
The underwater outfall will not contain the impacts on the ‘Posidonieto San Vito — Barletta’ SCI protected area (IT9120009), given the adverse effect on water quality likely to result from the possible spread of high pollution loads spilling into the receiving water body.
On 24 February 2017, a large quantity of foam and sludge was found to have accumulated at the outflow point of the treatment plant near Torre Calderina. In addition to the foam left at the waterline, there was a characteristic odour of surfactants. Acquedotto Pugliese says that the incident could have been caused by unauthorised non-compliant wastewater discharges downstream from the plant’s discharge point.

the substance or object is commonly used for specific purposes;
—
a market or demand exists for such a substance or object;

At the start of November, the Bulgarian website Bivol published recordings of a series of conversations between the judges Vladimira Yaneva and Rumyana Chenalova in which references are made to violation of the law. Both judges have since been removed from office and the public prosecutor has brought charges against them. It is clear from the checks conducted that the recordings were not made using any lawfully‐implemented investigative means and were done without proper authorisation, which is an offence, while at the same time it has not been established whether the content of the recordings are authentic or if these were doctored. The public prosecutor and Supreme Judicial Council have been conducting enquiries into the events.

In recent years I have repeatedly been contacted by Netherlands nationals who, while staying in Estonia, have been confronted with a wide range of products (‘souvenirs’) which, to put it mildly, awaken very uncomfortable memories of the Second World War and the Nazi regime. In several places, including the capital Tallinn, items including the following were on sale:
—

SS officers' caps and helmets,
—

red arm-bands with swastikas,
—

photos of Adolf Hitler,
—

matchboxes with images of the Third Reich,
—

souvenir t-shirts with pictures of Adolf Hitler,
—

Nazi German officers’ medals.

It is often argued that these are ‘collectors’ items’. However, it is undoubtedly true that they also appeal to people who find such ‘collectors’ items’ attractive, for whatever reason. The fact that the sale of such items is not banned in Estonia rightly gives rise to incomprehension and revulsion among many people. At any rate it prompts me to put the following questions:
1.

Is the Commission aware of the sale of the abovementioned items?
2.

Does the Commission agree that such items fly in the face of everything the EU stands for, in particular the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms (given that they symbolise totally opposite values)? If not, why not?
3.

Is the Commission prepared to raise this state of affairs with the Estonian authorities in order to put a stop to it? If not, why not?
4.

Can the Commission state whether similar products are also on sale in other EU countries? If so, can it state which countries, and whether any action has been taken against these countries?

In several countries, the liberalisation of the electric sector has patently failed to achieve the stated objectives. In fact, electricity prices for final consumers — families as well as enterprises — have increased rather than decreased, contrary to what had been promised.
The United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Brazil are examples of countries in which deregulation in the electrical sector has led to significant increases in electricity prices. The experiences in some of these countries have been used as case studies in academic work.
Specifically, the ending of vertical integration and the segmentation of the production and distribution chains, imposed by the EU, has had the effect of disaggregating production costs and of transferring to final consumers costs that prior to liberalisation had in each country been absorbed by the profits of a single company. The result is increased profits for large economic groups in the electric sector at the expense of families and enterprises, which instead face heavily increased energy bills.

Assistance for children with haemophilia in the ex-Soviet Union,WRITTEN QUESTION  by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2002-2027+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN,09-07-2002,E-2027/2002,1999-2004,2002,7,italy,Union for Europe of the Nations Group,1999-2004_2002_italy_union-for-europe-of-the-nations-group_7.html,126,E-2027_2002,"
The situation of children with haemophilia is particularly serious in the ex-Soviet Union because of the scarcity of clotting factors, which are vital for treatment of the illness. None of them can afford this type of therapy due to the high costs of, on average, EUR 500 per month. They suffer pointlessly, confined to wheelchairs due to their articular haematoma, regularly hospitalised for transfusions and isolated from their peers, since they cannot play.
Public, private and voluntary bodies, in Italy, and of course also in other European countries, provide assistance to the children through consignments of clotting factors in the knowledge that they will not be enough to cover all their needs. The different voluntary programmes are not coordinated and sometimes come up against bureaucratic obstacles in relation to customs and health regulations.

Therefore, will the Commission:
1.
promote the establishment of an information network at Community level of the local centres of blood products in order that at least a small quantity of clotting factors are distributed to the ex-Soviet countries?
2.
call on governments, and in particular health ministers, to undertake to coordinate financial assistance for the collection and authorised despatch of clotting factors in cooperation with the health minister of the Russian Federation?
3.
undertake to offer its services for humanitarian aid in terms of monitoring requirements and coordinating the authorised despatch of clotting factors in cooperation with the Russian authorities?

On 28 May 1997 the Commission presented a proposal for a Directive adapting to technical and scientific progress Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (COM(97)195 final). The proposal aimed, according to point 7 of the Explanatory Statement, to ‘remove the habitat sub-types (e.g. ""grey dunes"") which are now described in the Interpretation Manual EUR 15 version'. The proposal was adopted by the Council on 27 October 1997 (Directive 97/62/EEC (1).
1.   How is it being ensured that each of the specific habitat subtypes which were included in the original classification of certain habitats (Annex I to Directive 92/43/EEC (2)) is adequately represented in the Natura 2000 network?
2.   Leaving aside the previous question, are the Member States also required under Directive 92/43/EEC to designate a selection of areas such that sufficient variation within the different kinds of habitat is ensured?
3.   What is the legal status of the ""Interpretation Manual of European Habitats, version EUR 15"", which is referred to in the proposal and in the Annex to Directive 97/62/EEC, in comparison with an annex to a directive enacted by the Council?

In her answer to Written Question E-004000/2016, the Vice-President/High Representative stated that three of the four audits planned in Morocco in 2016 by the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) had been postponed and that the remaining audit (2016-8915) would not visit the Sahrawi-occupied territories.
On 21 December 2016, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled, in Case C-104/16 P — Council v Front Polisario, that the Association and Liberalisation Agreements concluded between the EU and Morocco are not applicable to Western Sahara.
According to DG SANTE’s website, four audits have been planned in Morocco in 2017 (2017-6227; 2017-6220; 2017-6190; 2017-6128).
Can the Commission confirm that, in accordance with the findings of the ECJ in Case C-104/16 P, the Health and Food Audits and Analysis service will not visit Moroccan infrastructures or other Moroccan entities located in the Sahrawi-occupied territories?
Can it clarify which national authorities it considers competent to deliver the food and safety certificates for products originating in Western Sahara, as required under EU legislation?

On 5 December 2017, Russia’s Ministry of Justice designated nine US Government-funded media outlets, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as ‘foreign agents’, a move that could complicate their news-gathering operations in Russia.
In his observations submitted to the European Court of Human Rights on a group of cases which challenge the so-called ‘Law on Foreign Agents’ before this Court, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muižnieks, stated that:
‘The application of this law has had a chilling effect on the work of civil society organisations in the Russian Federation and has considerably interfered with the rights to freedom of association and freedom of expression of many non-commercial organisations and human rights defenders, sometimes with severe consequences. Apart from the difficulties in securing funding, such groups and the persons working in them have been subjected to ostracism, harassment, and even physical attacks’.

A constant source of complaint from the Commission is the low number of applications for patents in Europe compared with the USA. The Community patent has been vaunted as a remedy even though it probably does not promote European inventions particularly. A more compelling reason for fewer patents may be the rules on the right to inventions made at universities. In the USA, it is the universities which hold the right to inventions; in Europe, it is the researchers. Often, however, they lack the financial resources and knowledge of the law to exploit inventions. This issue has been touched on in some of the Commission's most recent documents on innovation and biotechnology.
Has the Commission carried out any comparative study of university researchers' exploitation of their inventions? How different is the legislation in the various countries? Does the Commission intend to take any measures, within its sphere of competence, in this area? How many countries are in the process of reviewing this matter?

On 1 March 2011, the European Court of Justice delivered a ruling(1) negating a specific derogation inserted into the law of the European Union by the European Parliament and Council permitting premiums and annuities offered by companies to differ on the basis of gender where demonstrable variations in insurable risk arose due to a person’s gender.
Actuarial evidence exists showing male drivers on average have more car accidents than female drivers. Similarly, women benefit from higher life expectancy than men. Logically, this means the risk profile of a male driver or a female seeking health insurance will differ — a fact which the European institutions explicitly recognised in their approach in Article 5(2) of EU Directive 2004/113/EC.
As a direct result of the decision of the Court to ignore the express will of the Parliament and Council, the European insurance and reinsurance federation CEA expects that consumers will face significant additional costs; the Association of British Insurers, however, actually estimates that this decision will reinforce price discrimination, with women drivers under 26 in the UK facing a 25 % rise in car insurance rates, with a 10 % drop in rates for men.
What concrete steps will the Commission take to address this issue, which will penalise consumers — both male and female — and harm the European insurance and pensions industry?

Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 sets maximum levels for certain pollutants in food. Some species of fish from the Baltic contain high levels of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and are therefore not safe for consumption. A derogation from the regulation allows the sale of certain fish species from the Baltic with higher dioxin levels in two Member States, Sweden and Finland, provided that the necessary steps are taken to ensure that such fish and fish products are not sold in other Member States.
According to an article in the Swedish newspaper Göteborgsposten, there are signs that, despite the ban, fish with dioxin levels exceeding the maximum limits has been exported to other Member States. A Swedish fish exporter has also admitted to exporting to France 300 kilograms of salmon contaminated with dioxins.

Strife broke out between the English‐ and French-speaking communities in Cameroon in October 2017. Eight people were killed and several others injured in clashes between the army and protesters in the English-speaking area. The English-speaking community makes up a fifth of Cameroon’s population and has for some time been suffering discrimination at the hands of the French-speaking majority community and of the French-speaking Government, which has previously been accused of corruption. Under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Cameroon the regions used to enjoy wide-ranging autonomy, and French and English were both official languages. The English-speaking separatist movement, which has continued the protests, has been calling for a declaration of independence in order to bring about a complete secession, thereby creating the ‘Republic of Ambazonia’. 
In the light of these serious events: 
—
Is the High Representative aware of the abovementioned discrimination? What will she do to protect the English-speaking community in Cameroon, not least in view of the fact that the Cameroonian Army has resorted to shooting? 
—
How does she intend to respond to the possibility of secession and a self-declared ‘Republic of Ambazonia’?

In developing countries, 70 000 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 die every year due to pregnancy-related complications or during childbirth: this is a major cause of death for girls in that age group. Moreover, one in seven girls marries before her 15th birthday. These girls therefore become more likely to get pregnant than unmarried girls and less likely to go to school, and will have a lower income as adults, with severe consequences for their own lives and for the economic, human and social development of their countries.

The term of office of the Director of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) has recently been renewed. The usual term is five years, but this time an extension of only two years has been granted.
Limiting the term of office in this way will seriously jeopardize any research that is launched during the period concerned. Many research projects can obviously not be completed in such a time, and two years is also too short to draw any well-founded long-term conclusions.

I would like to address the provision in the fourth paragraph of Article 8(1) of the proposal for a directive on Energy Efficiency which imposes an obligation to install heat meters, and in multi-family buildings, additional individual heat consumption meters. If the installation of individual heat consumption meters is not technically feasible, according to the wording of the directive, individual heat cost allocators should be used.
Is the Commission aware of the additional costs associated with transposing the cited Directive into national law, in terms of requiring the owners and managers of multi-family buildings to install individual heat meters?
Is the Commission aware of the fact that the provisions in the directive may significantly increase the operating costs of premises in multi-family buildings?
In addition, the effectiveness of individual heat consumption meters and the method of calculating the costs of heat consumption in the form of heat cost allocators are questionable. As indicated in the research and opinions of many specialists in this field, foreign meters and the proposed form of heat cost allocators often do not work in multi-family building conditions (in particular in old buildings), showing extremely different heat consumption for apartments in the same building with the same degree of heating.

According to the information received from several NGOs, the women’s rights activist Maryam Bahreman was arrested on 11 May 2011 in Shiraz. Security force officers from the Intelligence Ministry went to her house with a detention order. They reportedly arrested her on the charge of ‘action against national security’.
Maryam Bahreman is a social activist and a member of ‘One million signatures’. She has been active in promoting women’s rights for several years. Her lawyer disclosed that she has been subjected to an interrogation relating to her human rights activities and in particular to her recent attendance at the 55th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women conference in New York in March of this year. The judicial procedure against her will start only after the interrogation has finished. She is at serious risk: torture or other ill-treatment of detainees in Iran is common, and is often used to force them to make ‘confessions’, often televised, which can be used as evidence against them in court, in violation of the prohibition of torture and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iran is a state party.

In the face of dwindling land-based deposits and the risk of supplies of some raw materials drying up, attention is turning to offshore multi-metal deposits containing many of the metals that are regarded as strategic raw materials. The Commission has identified 20 raw materials that are of critical importance to the development of highly advanced technologies. The risk of supplies of those materials drying up is being heightened by the limited use being made of recycled materials and the small scale of substitution efforts. Mineral scarcity is a real cause of concern for the EU. Although the EU is self-sufficient in construction minerals, of which it is a major producer, it accounts for only 3% of world production of metallic minerals. The EU as a whole is dependent on imports of metallic minerals and the metals needed for high-tech products. In many cases (doping metals being a prime example), all of the EU's needs are met by imports, and in the case of metals required for high-tech products the EU's dependency on imports may be regarded as critical, in view of those metals' economic value and the high supply risks associated with them.

In March 2016, following the decision by the Council of the EU to suspend direct financial support to the Burundian Government, including budgetary support, the EU undertook to review the arrangements for the payment of Burundian soldiers in the African Union’s mission to Somalia (Amisom). The agreement reached with the African Union was to pay the soldiers via a Burundian commercial bank to prevent their pay being routed via the Burundian Government which would deduct 20%. However, it appears that the forces’ pay is currently being channelled via a military cooperative (CECAD) controlled by the Ministry of Defence, and that the deductions are still taking place.

In its notification on construction work at Kassel-Calden airport, the Commission stresses that the project could possibly lead to night flights banned from Frankfurt/Main being transferred to Calden. The same thing could also be done with night flights from Cologne/Bonn and Düsseldorf.
It should be noted that the legally binding planning permit allows for only four flights per night — two take-offs and two landings —, as the Administrative Appeals Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) of Kassel explicitly confirmed in its judgment of 21 August 2009. Furthermore, night flights for freight aircraft are to be concentrated in Leipzig; night flights from Kassel-Calden would be in breach of this guideline.
It would appear that the government of the state of Hesse is misleading us by presenting the expansion of Kassel-Calden as a way of creating an alternative airport to relieve pressure on other airports.

By joint order 69269 of 30 March 1998 the Minister of the Environment, Regional Planning and Public Works and the Minister of the Merchant Maríne of Greece approved the above projected works. In November 1999 the Greek Government decided to go ahead with the work which was described as harbour works in order to benefit from Community funding. In fact the works are fundamentally transforming the urban and regional planning of the island by embankment of the entire length of the marine parade where the road runs along the beach, thus creating carriageways and additional areas allowing various bars and restaurants to set up tables beside the sea.
The environmental impact assessment does not seem to have been carried out in accordance with the relevant law (Law 1650/1986, Directive 85/337/EEC(1) and joint ministerial orders Nos 69269/5387/1990). The Council of State, to which an appeal was made on 11 November 1999 for suspension of the works, rejected the appeal on 18 January 2000 under a recently adopted provision, Article 35 of Law 2721/1999; the President of the Fifth Chamber of the Council of State merely invoked the concept of ""public interest"", without giving any reasons, and thus authorised resumption of the works(2). An appeal to annul the administration's decision was also lodged on 8 November 1999. When considering this appeal the Council of State deemed it admissible and thus contradicted itself by casting doubt on the public-interest argument advanced in its judgment of 18 January 2000. However, the appeal has been pending since it was lodged, and this has enabled the promoters of the works to complete them.
The possibility of widespread application of the above provision under Law 2721/1999 is dangerously restricting Greek citizens' right to temporary protection by the courts and is likely to allow the completion of works financed from Community funds that will have irreversible environmental consequences.
Can the Commission consider the above question and take the necessary measures with regard to the Greek authorities to ensure compliance with Community law, particularly the rules on environmental impact assessments?
Does the Commission not consider that there is a need to ask the Greek authorities to refund the Community funds granted for this project, if Community rules are not being complied with?
What, in the Commission's view, would be the risks caused by widespread application of the above provision under Law 2721/1999?

The assessment provides no details of the works or environment affected, no assessment of the consequences in all their possible forms, no detail of proposed pollution prevention, reduction or compensation measures, no consideration of advantages and disadvantages, no justification according to purely environmental criteria of the solution chosen and no analysis of alternative solutions to protect the Bay of Milos and its eco-system, the second largest natural bay in the Mediterranean. The Island of Milos is already severely affected by mineral extraction activities and plans to extend such activities, which are seriously affecting the environment (see Written Question E-0318/2000). The inclusion of the region on the west coast of Milos in the Natura 2000 network, under Directive 92/43/EEC, published in OJ L 206, 22.7.1992) is being held up by the local authorities who are mainly responsible for the works concerned.(2)The main reason for the works is to enlarge the area available for restaurants and bars.",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2000-3595&language=EN,E-3595/00,NA,commission

The recent study ‘Exposure to benzene as a carcinogen in environmental tobacco smoke in the hospitality sector’, carried out by Barcelona's Public Health Agency, looked at the concentration of nicotine and benzene in 37 bars in the city of Barcelona. An average concentration of 6.16 micrograms of benzene per cubic metre of air was measured in the bars, while Directive 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air sets an outdoor limit value of 5 μg/m3 of benzene. Despite the progress made in Spanish legislation with the introduction of anti-smoking measures in Law 28/2005, Spain is far from meeting the objectives of the Green Paper ‘Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke’, the Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments adopted in 2009, or the guidelines from the WHO Conference on Tobacco Control. In the light of this, Law 28/2005 is currently being amended to strengthen the areas in which progress has been less noticeable.

There continues to be a major shortage of pine resin products in Europe. Unfortunately, owing to falling prices and a lack of encouragement, production of pine resin has been abandoned in many areas, such as the Landes region of France.
A new resin tapping process (the 'closed vessel' technique) was developed recently. This process is more efficient and enables turpentine to be obtained by decantation, together with crystallized resin. A mobile distillation unit is then used for on-site conversion of the crystallized resin into gum rosin and turpentine. Trials are currently being conducted.

At a recent meeting with representatives of the employees of Fosforeira Portuguesa in Espinho, Portugal, the questioner was informed of the problems the company is experiencing, which may jeopardise its viability in the future. The issue is competition, because of imports of matches from the accession countries and third countries, such as China.

The results of a special Eurobarometer survey about the attitude of the European citizens to the welfare of farmed animals (published in June 2006) show that a minority of the population thinks that the welfare of pigs is unsatisfactory. One of the elements that surely contributes to a lower welfare of piglets is castration without anaesthesia. The EFSA-report ‘Welfare aspects of the castration of piglets’ (EFSA Journal (2004) 91, 1-18, page 18), says that this is painful and for newborn piglets it is even worse. In 1997 the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare concluded that castration causes severe pain and harm that, where possible, ‘should be prevented’.

At this moment, over 10 years later, the EU still allows the castration of piglets up to the age of seven days without anaesthetic. Although the European Parliament approved this in a resolution on 12 October 2006, this is obviously not reconcilable with the official policy of the Commission that recognises that animals are sentient beings (http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/index_en.htm).

Why has the Commission, in spite of convincing scientific evidence and a broad public consensus on the fact that pigs deserve better treatment, not yet taken measures to ensure that farmers abandon the castration of piglets — whatever their age may be — without anaesthesia?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2007-3035&language=EN,E-3035/07,NA,commission

1. Can the Commission confirm that the social dialogue introduced in Poland in connection with the adoption of the ""acquis communautaire"" of the European Union involves discussions being held once a year by the Polish government with national umbrella organisations of employees and employers, that these informal discussions do not lead to agreements and that they are not followed up by discussions between employees' and employers' organisations operating in individual sectors?
2. Can the Commission also confirm that there are no national or regional collective agreements in the construction sector in Poland, which includes housing, commercial and industrial buildings, roads, bridges and dams, but only agreements at the level of individual companies or their local branches?
3. Is the Commission aware that Polish construction workers are being squeezed out in their own country by Ukrainians who work for lower pay, and that this is encouraging Poles to look for work on building projects in the existing Member States of the EU, primarily in Germany where, following the completion of a number of major projects, there is a high level of unemployment in the construction sector, and in Austria, Finland and Sweden?
4. Is it attractive for employers to recruit Polish construction workers as they can in practice be employed on lower pay and less favourable conditions of employment than workers who have been resident for long time in the Member State concerned, insofar as they are not covered by a Polish collective agreement or by a collective agreement of the country where they are employed — provided that such an agreement has not been declared generally binding —, so that companies not belonging to an employers' organisation which is a contracting party to a collective agreement have no other obligations than to pay the minimum wage?

Exactly two years after the tragic fires in Greece, history is unfortunately repeating itself: once again catastrophic fires have devastated the forests of northern and eastern Attica, thereby depriving the Prefecture of its few remaining green ‘lungs’.

Bearing in mind that in a communication of March 2009, the Commission had proposed a series of specific measures and mechanisms aimed at improving the Union’s prevention, readiness and response capabilities in the event of disasters, such as fires, and recognising the dramatic reduction in forest cover in southern Europe, will the Council say:
1.
How well has the European preventive mechanism worked and to what extent have existing anti-fire mechanisms been set in motion this summer in southern Europe, bearing in mind that according to latest estimates by the European Forest Fire Information System, up to the middle of this year (2009) 200 000 hectares had been burnt in EU Member States, that is some 20 000 hectares more than in 2008?
2.
Has any assessment been carried out of planned measures to create and operate a European training network to address disasters and for the early warning of the intervention and rehabilitation phases in the event of disasters, inter alia, through the Global Monitoring for the Environment and Security (GMES) initiative and the use of the European single emergency call number (112)?
3.
What progress has been made in the execution of projects in Greece for the 2007‑13 period under the European Regional Fund and the Cohesion Fund to prevent and address risks, in particular as regards the Operational Programme for the Environment (2007‑13) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development as regards the restoration of forestry capacity and the introduction of preventive measures?
4.
How does it view the information contained in a recent WWF Greece report (July 2009) condemning the failure to include fire brigade and civil protection group volunteers in the Greek framework? How does it view the accusations made by the Association of Fire Brigade Officials regarding shortages of personnel, shortcomings in material and technical infrastructures and in the critical sector of prevention? What information is available about the take-up rate and the use of the available Community aid resources by Greece to carry out preventive measures in 2008‑09?

Is the Commission aware of the recent decision taken by British Airways and Iberia to implement a surcharge per ‘fare component’ on bookings made through the global distribution system (GDS), starting from 1 November 2017?

The military offensive launched on 27 December against the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Government is Israel's most important military offensive since the Six Days War of 1967.

Since June 2007 the entire Palestinian population of Gaza, 1.5 million people, has been trapped there under an imposed blockade.

Before the June ceasefire came into force, the first half of 2008 had seen 420 Palestinians killed at the hands of Israeli troops, including some 80 children. During the same period, armed Palestinian groups killed 24 Israelis, including four children.

On 4 November, Israeli troops carried out an overland raid and several attacks in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of six Palestinian activists. This unilateral breaking of the truce by Israel led to the launching of dozens of Palestinian rocket attacks on nearby areas and villages in the south of Israel, without causing any victims or damage.

By the eighteenth day of a war which contravenes international criminal and humanitarian law, 900 people had been killed and 4 000 had been seriously wounded.

Given the tragic situation in which the civilian population find itself,

does the Council intend to freeze the EU‑Israel Partnership Agreement as long as Israel fails to comply with Article 2 thereof, whereby the Agreement is dependent on respect for human rights?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2009-0249&language=EN,E-0249/09,NA,council

Promoting the development of digital television, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it is recommended that EU Member States switch off analogue terrestrial television by 2013. Multiplexed digital streams allow a large proportion of the frequency spectrum to be freed up. Freed-up frequencies can be used by Internet, mobile phone and other service providers. More effective frequency use will contribute to reducing the digital divide: wireless broadband will be available in rural areas and it will be simpler for more citizens to satisfy various social, economic and cultural needs that are becoming increasingly dependent on new technologies.
One of the main projects of the second pillar of the strategy for the Baltic Sea Region is to ‘coordinate the use of the digital dividend’.
Can the Commission indicate what measures are being used to coordinate the use of the digital dividend so that it is used more effectively? How are companies being encouraged to provide broadband services in sparsely populated areas? What has been achieved in the area of developing models of enhanced Member State cooperation for multilateral coordination and market control?",/doceo/document/E-7-2012-002565-ASW_EN.html,E-002565/2012,117,commission

The need to set up a Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) stems directly from the provisions of the Treaty, under which the European Union is required to promote the development and construction of infrastructure. This is intended to enhance economic and social cohesion within the EU, speed up economic growth and create new jobs. Thirty key TEN-T projects have been identified within the European Union. Four of these priority projects cross Polish territory and include the construction of a Gdańsk — Brno/Bratislava — Vienna motorway link. A large section of this motorway is being constructed within Kujawsko-Pomorskie province. This project has run into major difficulties over recent times, especially in the Czech Republic. 
Will the Commission take the necessary steps to ensure that the Gdańsk — Brno/Bratislava — Vienna motorway is completed on time?",/doceo/document/P-7-2010-2518-ASW_EN.html,P-2518/10,NA,commission
VP/HR - Nobel Peace laureate calls for caution regarding engagement with Iran,"Question for written answer E-014273/13by Fiorello Provera (EFD), by Charles Tannock (ECR)to the Commission",https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-7-2013-014273_EN.html,18-12-2013,E-014273/2013,2009-2014,2013,1,italy,European Conservatives and Reformists Group,2009-2014_2013_italy_european-conservatives-and-reformists-group_1.html,299,E-014273_2013,"
In early November 2013, Nobel Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi called for the USA and EU to ban Iran from using western satellites to broadcast what she described as Islamic Republic propaganda. Iran currently broadcasts programmes in more than a dozen languages around the globe via satellite. Ms Ebadi said that the government of Iran had to be prevented from using satellites and that such a ban would serve to shut off the ‘propaganda microphones of the government’. She also called for senior government officials to face travel bans and for those who have funds deposited with European and American banks to have their assets confiscated.
Ms Ebadi says she believed that President Hassan Rouhani would make changes once in power, but that nothing has changed. A spokesman for Iran’s mission to the UN, Alireza Miryousefi, has claimed that ‘Iran, especially after the election of President Rouhani, has put a new emphasis on the unwavering dedication towards the promotion and protection of all human rights inside and outside the country’.
Ms Ebadi notes, however, that according to the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), over 200 people, including four minors, were executed between 14 June and 1 October 2013. This is double the number of executions that took place in the same period in 2012. She has warned EU nations not to rush to restore ties with the government in Tehran without improvements to Iran’s human rights record.
1. What is the position of the Vice-President/High Representative regarding the Iranian Government’s use of European satellites to broadcast state-sponsored programmes?
2. What steps is the Vice-President/High Representative prepared to adopt to push for greater scrutiny of Iran’s human rights record?

The Commission has just published the results of its study on websites offering consumer credit. These ‘sweeps’ are particularly interesting, unlike ‘scoreboards’ which are of no interest to consumers.
They highlight the massive gaps that exist in the application of EU legislation. 

Can the Commission say:
—
why it refuses to give the names of financial organisations that do not comply with European legislation, since this makes the results useless for consumers and harmless for financial operators found to be at fault?
—
how it intends to monitor the effects of its recommendations when it has delegated full authority to the Member States?
—
how it explains the irregularities discovered for almost all operators in some Member States? 
—
what follow-up action was taken on previous ‘sweeps’, indicating the Commission’s analysis of the positive effects these had?

Passengers travelling with the major — mainly European — airlines have repeatedly complained about the restricted space available in economy class. In the case of trans-Atlantic and other long haul flights, the space between the seats in economy class is often much smaller than on internal European flights in order to accommodate more passengers. This situation can affect passenger health in numerous ways. With respect to passengers' rights in the European Union, does the Commission agree that passengers should be protected from exploitation by the airlines for the sake of profit? Will the Commission propose minimum standards with which European airlines must comply?",/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2008-0137&language=EN,E-0137/08,NA,commission
