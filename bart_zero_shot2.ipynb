In 2014, NATO troops are planning to leave the country and it is regarded as crucial by the international community that whoever takes over can ensure stability in the country.\\nThere are concerns that President Karzai is reluctant to hand over power, even though he has said that Afghanistan should not have to undergo political ‘experiments’ every few years, as he does not want to be held to account for any wrongdoings that occurred during his administration, and others claim he believes he is indispensable as President for the country’s future. Karzai has reportedly either obstructed or delayed several electoral reforms which are essential for ensuring a fair election process, such as having an electronic voter ID card. He has also yet to appoint new members to the National Election Commission.\\nThere are reportedly plenty of new candidates prepared to run in the elections, such as former and current cabinet members, Afghan-American businessmen. Even Karzai’s brother Qayum has put himself forward as a candidate. The issue at stake is that many of the candidates will try to compete on the basis that they control clans and militias.\\nIn 2012, under the Instrument for Stability, the\\xa0EU gave EUR\\xa010\\xa0million to Afghanistan to help the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission develop and consolidate capacity for future elections.\\n1.\\xa0What steps is the\\xa0EU taking to prepare for its long-term Election Observation Mission next year in Afghanistan?\\n2.\\xa0Has the Vice-President/High Representative taken steps to consult with other international leaders about the consequences if President Hamid Karzai runs for another term in 2014?\\n3.\\xa0What is the assessment of EU officials in Kabul about the prospects for next year’s election being free and fair?\\n4.\\xa0How is EU funding under the ‘Instrument for Stability’ being spent to prepare for these elections in Afghanistan?'},\n",
